      <h1>AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>
        The AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence promotes theoretical and
        applied AI research as well as intellectual interchange among
        researchers and practitioners. The technical program features
        substantial, original research and practices. Conference panel
        discussions and invited presentations identify significant social,
        philosophical, and economic issues influencing AI’s development
        throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior research speculates many reasons why AI investments are not
        yielding value due in part to a lack of expertise, inadequate
        technological infrastructure, high levels of perceived complexity, and
        dubious outcomes (Bean 2021; Bergstein 2019; Meakin et al. 2021). In
        fact, these factors may lead to satisficing—sub-optimal decision
        making—that can impede AI-enabled strategic cognition and capability
        learning in organizations (Simon 1957; Winter 2000). Despite the
        slowness of AI implementation success, many organizations continue to
        see a great promise in AI.

          <h2>
            Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and
            Peter Norvig.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach is a comprehensive
            textbook on artificial intelligence. The book is designed to be
            accessible to students with a background in computer science and
            provides a broad overview of the field, covering a wide range of
            topics including search algorithms, machine learning, natural
            language processing, and robotics.

          <h2>The Master Algorithm and it’s by Pedro Domingos.</h2>
          <p>
            The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning
            Machine Will Remake Our World is a book by Pedro Domingos that
            discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on
            society and the quest to develop the “master algorithm,” which could
            potentially learn to perform any intellectual task that a human can.
            Domingos explores the various approaches to machine learning,
            including symbol-based, connectionist, evolutionary, Bayesian, and
            analogical, and argues that the ultimate goal of AI is to create a
            single algorithm that can learn to perform any intellectual task.

            Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
          </h2>
          <p>
            Deep learning has become a key technique in artificial intelligence
            and has been responsible for many of the most significant advances
            in the field in recent years, including the development of
            self-driving cars, automatic translation systems, and image
            recognition systems. As such, Deep Learning is an important resource
            for anyone interested in understanding how deep learning works and
            how it can be applied to solve a wide range of problems.

      <p>
        Karachi, city and capital of Sindh province, southern Pakistan. It is
        the country’s largest city and principal seaport and is a major
        commercial and industrial centre. Karachi is located on the coast of the
        Arabian Sea immediately northwest of the Indus River delta.
        <br />
        The city has been variously called Caranjee, Crochey, Krotchey,
        Currachee, and Kurrachee, all of which are believed to be variants of
        the same name. In the 18th century it was known as
        Kalachi-jo-Goth,meaning “the village of Kalachi” (Kalachi being the name
        of an erstwhile head of the settlement).

      <h2>Why Chai is Best</h2>
      <p>
        Green tea is exceptionally high in flavonoids that can help boost your
        heart health by lowering bad cholesterol and reducing blood clotting.
        Studies show this type of tea can also help lower blood pressure,
        triglycerides and total cholesterol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, the
        same plant that’s used to make green tea. However, the leaves are dried
        and fermented, giving black tea a darker color and richer flavor. Unlike
        many other varieties, black tea is caffeinated, so it’s important to
        monitor your intake. When you do pour yourself a cup of black tea, you
        benefit from flavonoids that combat inflammation and support healthy
        immune function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea variety that’s made from the
        same plant used to make green and black teas. The difference is how the
        tea is processed: Green tea is not allowed to oxidize much, but black
        tea is allowed to oxidize until it turns black. Oolong tea is somewhere
        in between the two, so it is partially oxidized. This partial oxidation
        is responsible for oolong tea's color and characteristic taste.
